## 💡 About The Project

This ATM Management System is designed to mimic the core functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using a clean and user‑friendly web interface. Users can access basic banking features such as logging in with account details, checking balance, depositing, withdrawing funds, and viewing transaction history — all in the browser.

This project is ideal for beginners learning front‑end development or anyone exploring how banking operations can be simulated in a web environment.
